## Duck model edits

I made changes to my duck model in preparation to begin rigging it. 

- Fixed mouth loops to fix some smoothing issues
- Edited the eye loops, making the top and bottom vert counts the same (Yvonne's suggestion)
    - I wanted to make sure a full blink was possible, so I created a test blend shape

## Journal website

I used a neat site generator to set this site up! It's called [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

It required:

- Working in the command line
- Working with Git, and GitHub
- Creating a Python venv (virtual environment), and installing packages into it

Some of that was new, and fun to learn a bit about. It's not really related to the main project, I know, but I'll mention it here since it's something I did.
